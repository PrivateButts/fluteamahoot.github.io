Never has solving the world's problems been so easy! All you need is an Android or iOS device and some people to get into a disagreement over. The game is simple- don't get out. The last person standing gets the last slice of pizza, or waffle or something. How do you get out? Through the door silly! Really though, just hold your phone still. That's it. If your so called friends decide to knock your phone out of your hand that's their (recommended) choice. So get some friends, break their phones, and win the last slice of pizza! That'll show them.
