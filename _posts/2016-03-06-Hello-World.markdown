Hey you! Welcome to the site with all the gaming related news you'll need! I mean, even though we haven't released anything yet, or even announced what we're working on, we're still the only game developer you'll ever need to stay informed on.

So a bit about ourselves would be helpful to put in a post like this. The person writing this post/this site right now is Randy. I'm handling all the design and programming at the moment. There's also a couple people that are on a more freelancy shindig right now, but if they do join on full time, there will be a post about it. I'll have a more detailed post within a week that'll delve into what we're building.

As for these blogs, Someone will write one once every other week at least. Keeps us on track.


Thanks for reading,

Randy
